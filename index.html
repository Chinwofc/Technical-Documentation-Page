        Front-end development primarily focuses on user experience. Using the related coding and design techniques. 
        Front-end developers build the elements of an application that are accessed directly by end-users with a 
        goal of rendering the entire interface elegant, easy to use, fast, and secure, fostering user engagement and 
        interaction.
    <p>
        As part of creating an engaging user interface, front end app development often focuses on specific design 
        elements such as text colors and styles, images, graphs and tables, buttons, and overall color schemes. These
         elements play a crucial role in enhancing the visual appeal and user-friendliness of the application.

    <p><code>
                  Front end app development encompasses various interactive elements like sliders, pop-up forms, 
                  and custom interactive maps. An essential part of a front end application are navigational menus, 
                  which guide users through the application, enhancing their overall experience and interaction with
                   the website or application. The creation of intuitive and user-friendly navigational menus is a 
                   key skill for front-end developers.

    <li>HTML</header>
        Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web 
        browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as 
        Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
    <p><code>
        HMTL is used for Structuring of web pages. With tags and elements, we can define the headings, paragraphs, 
        and other contents of a web page. Navigating the internet. Embedding images and videos. Improving client-side 
        data storage and offline capabilities. Game development and Interacting with native APIs.</code>

        HTML is primarily used to develop web pages and web applications that run on web browsers like Chrome, 
        Firefox, and Internet Explorer. HTML tags are keywords present on a web page that define how your web browser
         must format and display the contents.

        CSS is the acronym of “Cascading Style Sheets”. CSS is a computer language for laying out and structuring 
        web pages (HTML or XML). his language contains coding elements and is composed of these “cascading style 
        sheets” which are equally called CSS files (.css).

      <ul><li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li></ul>

    <li>JAVASCRIPT</header>
        JavaScript allows you to embed expressions directly within the string using placeholders, denoted by 
        ${expression} . The dollar sign followed by curly braces ${} is used to evaluate and embed expressions 
        dynamically in template literals.

        Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few 
        implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let 
        programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that 
        support Java without the need to recompile.
    <p>
        Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless
         of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level 
         facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime
          code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.
